# Hokuyo-Unity-Sensor\n\n## Status: WORKING IN PROGRESS\n\nThis project is an enhanced version based on https://github.com/inoook/UnityURG designed for more interactive and maximized functionality.\n\n*Please note: The code is still at a very primitive state, object detection can be improved*\n\nImprovements and contributions are highly encouraged.\n\nThis library works with multiple Hokuyo sensors, unique IPs need to be assigned to each sensor.\n\n## Purpose\n\nA large wall is transformed into a "touch screen" with the help of Hokuyo sensors. The project is focused on detecting objects on a surface, hence the _strength_ data from the sensor is overlooked, but features like _distance cropping mechanism_ are added to efficiently detect objects on the surface.\n\nTwo methods for detection area restriction:\n\n- Rect: Things within a rectangular area are detected. Customizable area dimensions.\n- Radius: It detects in a circular sector. Detection radius changeable.\n\nIn both methods, objects behind are ignored.\n\n## Preparations\n\nNetwork settings need to be appropriately configured before data retrieval:\nhttps://sourceforge.net/p/urgnetwork/wiki/ip_address_en/\n\n## Files\n\n- 'URGSensorObjectDetector': Object detection from sensor raw data\n- 'UrgDeviceEthernet': To get raw data from sensor\n- 'SCIP_library': Utility for low-level communication with the sensor\n\n## How to use\nAttach _URGSensorObjectDetector_ to an empty GameObject or use the Prefab _Sensor Data_\n\n## Warning\nCode is tested with **Hokuyo UST-10LX**. May work with other Hokuyo sensors but it's not guaranteed.
